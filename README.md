prezto
======

A fast and simple slideshow system with HTML5 + CSS + JavaScript

## About

prezto is a lightweight slideshow system that uses HTML5, CSS and JavaScript. It has
less features than the majority of web-based slideshow systems (S5, Slidy,
Slidedown or Showoff for example) and is just &lt;200 lines of JS.

prezto is meant to be simple to use by everyone. You just need to have some
basic HTML and CSS knowledge. Advanced users may use custom JS to enhance the
experience.

## Features

* Simple, standard keyboard interaction (space, right, left)
* A menu to quickly jump to a slide
* Easy to share slideshow: just drop your HTML file on a web server
* Minimal requirements (a text editor is barely the only thing you need)
* Use well-known and widespread standards
* Use of custom JS when you need it

These are the things you won't have with prezto (at least without tweaking):

* Fancy transitions and animations between slides
* Automatic font scaling
* Syntax highlighted code (although this is easy to add)
* and certainly many moreâ€¦

## Controls

* space, right arrow: next slide
* left arrow: previous slide
* home: first slide
* m: toggle menu
