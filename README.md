A simple slideshow system with HTML+CSS+JavaScript

## About

js3 is a lightweight slideshow system that uses HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It has
less features than the majority of web-based slideshow systems (S5, Slidy,
Slidedown or Showoff for example) and is just &lt;200 lines of JS.

js3 is meant to be simple to use by everyone. You just need to have some basic
HTML and CSS knowledge. Advanced users may use custom JS to enhance the
experience.

## Features

* Simple, standard keyboard interaction (space, right, left)
* A menu to quickly jump to a slide
* Easy to share slideshow: just drop your HTML file on a web server
* Minimal requirements (a text editor is barely the only thing you need)
* Use well-known and widespread standards
* Use of custom JS when you need it
* A help box, just in case ;)

These are the things you won't have with js3 (at least without tweaking):

* Fancy transitions and animations between slides
* Automatic font scaling
* Syntax highlighted code (althoug this is easy to add)
* and certainly many moreâ€¦
